## Introduction

Quikk demonstrates how to build a full-stack web application using React with TypeScript for type safety and Appwrite as a backend-as-a-service (BaaS). Appwrite simplifies backend development by providing pre-built services for authentication, database, storage, functions, and more. This project focuses on showcasing core blog functionalities, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting posts, along with user authentication.

## Features

* **User Authentication:** Secure user registration and login using Appwrite's authentication service.
* **Create Blog Post:** Authors can create new blog posts with titles, content, and optional images.
* **Read Blog Posts:** Display a list of blog posts with pagination and individual post details.
* **Update Blog Post:** Authors can edit their existing blog posts.
* **Delete Blog Post:** Authors can delete their blog posts.
* **Image Upload:** Upload images for blog posts using Appwrite's storage service.
* **Responsive Design:** The application is designed to be responsive across different screen sizes.
* **TypeScript:**  Built with TypeScript for improved code maintainability and type safety.

## Technologies Used

* **Frontend:**
    * React
    * TypeScript
    * [Other relevant libraries like React Router, Material UI, etc.]
* **Backend:**
    * Appwrite
* **Other:**
    * [Any other relevant technologies]

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone (https://github.com/DivyamSingh19/Quill.git)
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd Quill
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install  # or yarn install
   ```

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following environment variables:

```
REACT_APP_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=[Your Appwrite Endpoint]
REACT_APP_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=[Your Appwrite Project ID]
# Add other environment variables as needed
```

* **`REACT_APP_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT`**: Your Appwrite endpoint (e.g., `http://localhost/v1` for local development or your cloud function endpoint).
* **`REACT_APP_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID`**: Your Appwrite project ID.

## Running the App

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start  # or yarn start
   ```

2. **Open the app in your browser:**
   http://localhost:5173 (or the port specified by your development server)
